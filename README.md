# ActSim

This repository contains the web interface and documentation for a tactical
training simulator. The `/unreal` folder holds the Unreal Engine project used
for VR scenes while the `/server` and `/client` folders contain the Node.js API
and React front‑end.

## Running the Web App

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

The server will start on port `5000` and host both the API and the front‑end.

## Unreal VR Scene

Setup instructions and C++ source for the VR demo are located in
[`unreal/README.md`](unreal/README.md).
